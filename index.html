      <h2>Some Mathematical background</h2>
      <p>
        Inf represents infinite and infinitesimal quantities as <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_field">Levi-Civita numbers</a>.
        Calculus students often get the impression that the notion of an infinite or infinitesimal number can never be
        defined in any rigorous or
        self-consistent way. That's not true. Tullio Levi-Civita defined the Levi-Civita numbers around 1900, so it's
        been known for over a
        century that there were rigorously definable number systems that included infinities.
        Great mathematicians like Newton, Gauss, and Euler used
        infinitesimals, and now that modern mathematicians have put them on a more rigorous footing, there's
        no reason to shy away from them.
        To learn more about the application of infinitesimals
        to calculus, see Ben Crowell's <a href="http://www.lightandmatter.com/calc/">free calculus book</a>.
        (If you've ended up here because the calculus book tells you about the calculator, one thing you should realize
        is that the Levi-Civita
        numbers used by Inf are not the full hyperreal number system referred to in the book. They are a subset of them,
        in the same way
        that the rational numbers are a subset of the real numbers. This is why certain calculations give an error
        in the calculator, even though they are well defined in the hyperreals.)
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two basic things to understand about this system:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> The Levi-Civita numbers obey all the same <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">elementary</a> axioms of arithmetic as the real
          numbers.
        <li> The system contains many different sizes of infinite numbers, and many sizes of
          infinitesimals, but all of them are expressed in terms of the basic building block d, which is a positive
          infinitesimal that we arbitrarily
          single out and give a name.
      </ol>
      <p>
        Here are some examples you can try in the calculator to get a feeling for how all this works:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> d>0 ... true, because although d is infinitesimal, it's still greater than zero
        <li> d&lt;10^-10 ... true, because d is smaller than any positive real number
        <li> 1/0 ... undefined
      </ul>
      <p>
        The expression 1/0 comes up as undefined, not an infinite number. This is because one of the elementary
        axioms of arithmetic is that division by zero is undefined. To get an infinite result, you could do something
        like 1/d, where d is the symbol
        built in to the calculator to represent one particular infinitesimal number.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 1/d ... doesn't cause an error like 1/0 did
        <li> 1/d>1000000 ... true, because 1/d is infinite
        <li> d^2&lt;d ... true, showing that we have different sizes of infinitesimals
        <li> sqrt(d)>d ... true
      </ul>
      <p>
        To see why there have to be many different sizes of infinities, and of infinitesimals, consider the following
        example. We can
        prove from the elementary axioms of arithmetic is that if x is greater than zero, then 2x is greater than x.
        This applies to
        Levi-Civita numbers as well, so infinite and infinitesimal numbers have to come in different sizes. In
        particular, there isn't
        anything in the Levi-Civita system that plays the role of &infin;, which is usually used as a generic symbol for
        infinity.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> d^2&gt;0 ... true, because even though d^2 is infinitesimally small compared to d, it's still not zero
      </ul>
      <p>
        This shows that the traditional practice of neglecting the square of an infinitesimal can't be formalized in the
        Levi-Civita system simply by
        equating it to zero. We can, however, say that neglecting a d<sup>2</sup> term compared to a d is an infinitely
        good approximation. Here is an example
        of numerical calculus, in which we calculate the derivative of x<sup>4</sup>, evaluated at x=2:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> [(2+d)^4-2^4]/d
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result is 32+(24)d+8d<sup>2</sup>+d<sup>3</sup>, corresponding to the fact that the derivative is 32.
        The right way to handle this is not to say that the trailing terms are zero, but simply to define the derivative
        as the <i>standard part</i>
        of the quotient dy/dx, meaning its leading term that has no d in it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 1/(1-d) ... is calculated using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series">geometric
            series</a>, up to a certain level of precision
        <li> exp(d) ... is calculated using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a>
        <li> (1-cos d)/d ... gives an infinitesimal result, which is equivalent to the statement that
          lim<sub>x&rarr;0</sub>[(1-cos d)/d]=0, as can be verified by L'H&ocirc;pital's rule
      </ul>
      For convenience in the following, let's define an infinite variable h.
      <ul>
        <li> h=1/d
        <li> h ... spits back its representation in terms of the basic building block d
        <li> 2*h>h ... true, because 2h is a bigger infinity than h
        <li> 2*h+1>2*h ... and an even bigger infinity
        <li> sqrt(h+1)-sqrt(h-1) ... shows that this expression is (perhaps counterintuitively) infinitesimal
        <li> exp(h) ... is undefined in the Levi-Civita system
      </ul>
      <p>
        To amplify on statement 2 above, the infinitesimal
        d doesn't have any special properties that would allow it to be picked out from among all the other positive
        infinitesimals. We just assume
        it can be picked arbitrarily from the set of positive infinitesimals. The arbitrariness of this choice can be
        understood by analogy with
        the complex numbers. To construct the complex numbers, we start by assuming that a solution to the equation
        x<sup>2</sup>+1=0 exists.
        It follows from the axioms of algebra that there are two such solutions with opposite signs, since the sign of x
        doesn't affect the value of x<sup>2</sup>.
        We call one of these i, and the other -i. Note that it makes absolutely no difference which one is i and which
        is -i. Similarly in the case
        of the Levi-Civita numbers, we assume that a positive solution exists to the infinite set of simultaneous
        equations {x<1, x<1/2, x<1/3, ...}. Assuming such a solution, which is interpreted as an infinitesimal number,
          it follows that we can find many other solutions as we like. Out of all the solutions, we arbitrarily pick one
          and call it d. </p>
          <p>
            The undefined result for exp(1/d) is an example of how the Levi-Civita numbers are a smaller system than the
            hyperreals,
            which were defined by Abraham Robinson around 1960. The hyperreals match the properties of the real numbers
            even better than the Levi-Civita numbers do.
            For example, the exponential function can take a positive infinite argument in the hyperreal system, but
            that doesn't work in the Levi-Civita
            numbers. However, the hyperreals cannot be conveniently represented on a computer.
