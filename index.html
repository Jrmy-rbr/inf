<h1>Inf</h1>
<p>Inf is a calculator that can handle infinite and infinitesimal numbers. This is an early alpha release, and it's more likely
to work well in Firefox than in Internet Explorer.

<h2>About Inf</h2>

<p>
Inf is a calculator that can handle infinite and infinitesimal numbers.
</p>
<p>
Predefined constants:
<ul>
<li> i -- the square root of -1
<li> pi -- the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter
<li> d -- an infinitesimally small number
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Built-in operators:
<ul>
<li> : -- assigns the expression on the right to the variable named on the left-hand side
<li> =, <, > -- comparisons
<li> +, -, *, / -- arithmetic
<li> ^ -- exponentiation
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Built-in functions:
<ul>
<li> sin, cos, tan
<li> asin, acos, atan
<li> sqrt, abs
<li> exp, ln
<li> floor, ceil
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Inf represents infinite and infinitesimal quantities as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_field">Levi-Civita numbers</a>.
The Levi-Civita numbers obey all the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">elementary</a> axioms of arithmetic as the real numbers.
If you try evaluating the expression 1/0, you'll see that it comes up as undefined, not an infinite number. This is because one of the elementary
axioms of arithmetic is that division by zero is undefined. To get an infinite result, you could do something like 1/d, where d is the symbol
built in to the calculator to represent one particular infinitesimal number. Another thing that
can be proved from the elementary axioms of arithmetic is that if x is greater than zero, then 2x is greater than x. This applies to
Levi-Civita numbers as well, so infinite and infinitesimal numbers have to come in different sizes. In particular, there isn't
anything in the Levi-Civita system that plays the role of &infin;, which is usually used as a generic symbol for infinity.
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples you can try in the calculator to get a feeling for how all this works:
<ul>
<li> 1/0 ... undefined
<li> 1/d ... gives an infinite result
<li> 2/d ... a bigger infinity
<li> 2/d+1 ... and an even bigger infinity
<li> d>0 ... true
<li> d<10^-10 ... true
<li> d^2<d ... true, showing that we have different sizes of infinity
<li> d^2>0 ... true, because even though d^2 is infinitesimally small compared to d, it's still no zero
<li> sqrt(d)
<li> sqrt(d)>d ... true
<li> 1/(1-d) ... is calculated using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series">geometric series</a>, up to a certain level of precision
<li> exp(d) ... is calculated using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a>
<li> exp(1/d) ... is undefined in the Levi-Civita system
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Calculus students often get the impression that the notion of an infinite or infinitesimal number can never be defined in any rigorous or
self-consistent way. That's not true. Tullio Levi-Civita defined the Levi-Civita numbers around 1900, so it's been known for over a
century that there were rigorously definable number systems that included infinities. Abraham Robinson defined another such number system,
the hyperreal numbers, around 1960. The hyperreals match the properties of the real numbers even better than the Levi-Civita numbers do.
For example, the exponential function can take a positive infinite argument in the hyperreal system, but that doesn't work in the Levi-Civita
numbers. However, the hyperreals cannot be conveniently represented on a computer. Great mathematicians like Newton, Gauss, and Euler used
infinitesimals, and now that modern mathematicians like Levi-Civita and Robinson have put infinitesimals on a more rigorous footing, there's
no reason to shy away from them.

Inf is free and open source. It's under the GPL v. 2 license. Since it's all written in client-side javascript,
you can see the source code simply by doing "view source" in your browser; actually most of the code is in separate
modules pointed to from the html source code, but you can view those through your browser as well by pointing it at each
URL. Alternatively, you can access it via a web browser or git, at <a href="http://github.com/bcrowell/inf">via github</a>.
