Inf is a calculator that can handle infinite and infinitesimal numbers. You can [run it in your browser](http://www.lightandmatter.com/calc/inf/). For documentation, scroll down in that window.

I wrote the software in 2009, and since then I haven't been doing any work on it other than bug fixes and maintenance. In 2022, [Jeremy](https://github.com/Jrmy-rbr) showed an interest in doing more serious work on the code. I felt like I would only be holding him back if he always had to get my approval to make changes, so I suggested a friendly fork, which he did. His version is [at this URL](https://github.com/Jrmy-rbr/inf).
